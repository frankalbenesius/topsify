# Spotify Top Tracks

A React app that uses the Spotify Web API to help Spotify users generate a playlist based on their top played tracks.

You can find the live app [here](https://spotify.albenesi.us).

To run locally:

1. [Create a Spotify App](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications) and swap out your new Client ID in `modules/spotify.js`.
2. Update the redirect URIs of your new Spotify Application to match your app's location.
3. Install dependencies with 'yarn install'.
4. Run it with 'yarn run dev'.
